*work in progress*

So, I had been intending to write a 500-word review for each movie I watched. That hasn't happened. It's boring.

However, four months ago I saw *The End of the Tour* which is based off of David Lipsky's 
*Although Of Course You End up Becoming Yourself*. The book consists of an extended interview Lipsky did with Wallace for 
Rolling Stone in 1996 while the latter toured the country doing book readings prior to the release of 
his masterpiece, *Infinite Jest*.

I remember seeing Lipsky's book in Barnes and Noble years ago when I'd wander around there prior to watching a movie.
I never picked it up but there was something fascinating about the title and the guy and his dog on the front. 

Who was that guy?

David Foster Wallace was a writer who loved to embrace his Midwestern guy next door persona, which was impossible because he was absolutely brilliant. Read any of his stuff, whether essays, books, or interviews, and you'll often find him entertaining and always thoughtful even if you disagree.

His writing sets him apart. I'm fairly well-read. I love to read. I made an attempt at *Infinite Jest* this summer (a 1000-page tome with coious footnotes), and have thus far made it through three chapters. Not because I don't enjoy it, but because the writing demands so much attention. It's unlike anything I've ever read. Each scene is extreme and bizarre, but it is that strangeness which transports you there so completely.

Unfortunately for Wallace, he's known as much for his battles with depression and suicide in 2008 at 46. 

Yes, that story is what drew me in. I read *A YEUBY* prior to picking up *IJ*. They cover a lot of ground and say a lot of interesting things. Wallace says TV is like candy; it's not filling (TV had an addictive appeal for him). He was wrong on what he thought the Internet would turn into, and tantalizing when he talks of some future real, honest political candidate (I wonder if Trump is this notion gone wrong). They discuss *The Last of the Mohicans* and Alanis Morisette.

*The End of the Tour* is a fairly straight-forward adaption of the book. Some parts are left out, but you get a real feel for the man. It's well-shot for what it is (diners, airports, car interiors). However, it's a niche movie. Unless you really likfe DFW or love the genre of interview movies, you probably won't enjoy it.

This is too bad. This movie has something to say. I found the scene with Brian Eno's *The Big Ship* haunting and touching, but the deepest part of the movie nnolves two small scenes right at the end. Technically this is a spoiler and probably the climax of the movie, but too much is said to leave it untold.
