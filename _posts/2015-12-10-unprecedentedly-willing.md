*work in progress*

So, I had been intending to write a 500-word review for each movie I watched. That hasn't happened. It's boring.

However, four months ago I saw *The End of the Tour* which is based off of David Lipsky's 
*Although Of Course You End up Becoming Yourself*. The book consists of an extended interview Lipsky did with Wallace for 
Rolling Stone in 1996 while the latter toured the country doing book readings prior to the release of 
his masterpiece, *Infinite Jest*.

I remember seeing Lipsky's book in Barnes and Noble years ago when I'd wander around there prior to watching a movie.
I never picked it up but there was something fascinating about the title and the guy and his dog on the front. 

Who was that guy?

David Foster Wallace was a writer who loved to embrace his Midwestern guy next door persona, which was impossible because he was absolutely brilliant. Read any of his stuff, whether essays, books, or interviews, and you'll often find him entertaining and always thoughtful even if you disagree.

His writing sets him apart. I'm fairly well-read. I love to read. I made an attempt at *Infinite Jest* this summer (a 1000-page tome with coious footnotes), and have thus far made it through three chapters. Not because I don't enjoy it, but because the writing demands so much attention. It's unlike anything I've ever read. Each scene is extreme and bizarre, but it is that strangeness which transports you there so completely.

Unfortunately for Wallacew, he's known just as much for his writing as he is for his depression which lead to his suicide in 2008 at 46.
