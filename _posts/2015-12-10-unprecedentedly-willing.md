*work in progress*

So, I had been intending to write a 500-word review for each movie I watched. That hasn't happened. It's boring.

However, four months ago I saw *The End of the Tour* which is based off of David Lipsky's 
*Although Of Course You End up Becoming Yourself*. The book consists of an extended interview Lipsky did with Wallace for 
Rolling Stone in 1996 while the latter toured the country doing book readings prior to the release of 
his masterpiece, *Infinite Jest*.

I remember seeing Lipsky's book in Barnes and Noble years ago when I'd wander around there prior to watching a movie.
I never picked it up but there was something fascinating about the title and the guy and his dog on the front.
