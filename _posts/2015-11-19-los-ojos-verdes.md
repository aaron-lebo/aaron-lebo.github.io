SCENE 1

the writer, <br />
vonnegut, <br />
says to write for<br />
an audience of one.<br />
so though many will read this,<br />
it is only for your <br />
green eyes.<br />

i remember when we first met,<br />
you said you liked my dog,<br />
and said you liked his name.<br />
if i saved his life ten times over,<br />
i couldn't pay him back.<br />

i looked at pictures,<br />
approximations of <br />
you.<br />
i read your words,<br />
only a summary of your<br /> 
soul.<br />

but still,<br />
even then,<br />
you grabbed me.<br />

i asked of your country,<br />
and found it was <br />
the place<br />
my heart has always been.<br />
at least a quarter of it, <br />
anyway.<br />
a place i have roots,<br />
a place that calls to me. <br />
a place where they speak,<br />
a language from my youth.<br />

i have been indifferent<br />
to so many others.<br />
if we clicked,<br />
we clicked.<br />
but if not,<br />
we'd be like objects in space,<br />
speeding by,<br />
never to cross paths<br />
again.<br />
nothing lost<br />
and nothing gained.<br />

but on that night,<br />
i knew,<br />
i must meet you.<br />
you were a dream;<br />
were you a reality?<br />

i put on my best words.<br />
though i flattered you,<br />
it was all<br />
true.

you may not have known<br />
how i was <br />
alone.<br />
but i assure you,<br />
the feeling was mutual.<br />
though i knew<br />
it was by<br />
choice.

somehow,<br />
our conversation stretched<br /> 
into the next day.<br />

i thought of your voice.<br />
i knew it must be <br />
beautiful.<br />
i wondered if i would hear it.<br />

i told el artista<br />
how badly<br />
i wanted to woo you.<br />

i was in a room of people<br />
when you said you'd call.<br />
i left the room,<br />
sat on stairs, <br />
and looked at empty cars.<br />

you never called.<br />
maybe we were on different orbits,<br />
never to cross paths<br />
again.<br />
something lost<br />
and nothing gained.<br />

SCENE 2

but the next day,<br />
you asked what i should have.<br />
why should we call,<br />
when we could meet?<br />

of course,<br />
to meet,<br />
we had to call.<br />

i remember when i first heard your<br />
voice,<br />
the reality<br />
was better than<br />
the dream.

funny.<br />
we both took classes<br />
in that green building.<br />
how many times<br />
had we passed by,<br />
walking a hallway,<br />
driving a road.<br />
only to meet<br />
in pictures and words.<br />

you asked if i was nervous.<br />
i'm a terrible liar.<br />
hell yes,<br />
i was nervous.<br />

stargazing<br />
too ambitious.<br />
we'd meet<br />
at that park downtown.<br />
you'd bring a blanket for sitting,<br />
and i'd grab the drinks for drinking, <br />
and the teddy for petting.<br />

teddy roosevelt.<br />
not to be trusted.<br />
a pup in a pit's body.<br />
but hungry and curious.<br />
maybe not unlike me<br />
or you.

bringing him was<br /> 
a risk.<br />
but if you wanted me to bring him along,<br />
i sure as hell was bringing him along.

i left early,<br />
got lost,<br />
couldn't find the wine,<br />
and when i texted i was close,<br />
realized you hadn't left. 

got lost<br />
downtown,<br />
$20 to park<br />
(worth it),<br />
got scared and left the beer.

walked to the park<br /> 
where a drunk couple fawned over ted.<br />
couldn't find you,<br />
heard annoyance in that <br />
pretty voice.

wondered if my<br /> 
chance<br />
was slipping<br /> 
away.<br />
another couple<br />
thought ted a killer.<br />
and i was glad to get around<br />
the corner.

looked around.<br />
didn't see you.<br />
then i heard my name<br />
in a familiar<br />
note.

there you were<br />
standing under <br />
the light.<br />
that moment<br />
is not like part of a dream<br />
that you forget when you wake.<br />
i can't forget <br />
because<br />
the reality<br />
was better than<br />
the dream. 

i put my arms around you for<br /> 
the first time.<br />
we sat and talked.<br />
teddy was restless,<br />
almost lost my chair.<br />
surely that is all part of<br />
the charm?

we moved to the grass.<br />
while children ran around us,<br />
we sized each other<br />
up.

we laughed,<br />
we advanced,<br />
and then retreated.<br />
we rinsed<br />
and repeated.<br />
who are you?<br />
who am i?

teddy barked<br />
and bolted.<br />
my head,<br />
your knee.<br />
it only hurt<br />
my pride.

you told me of that city<br />
where the sun sets at three.<br />
i knew this because<br />
that city<br />
had been my escape.

el artista knows how many times<br />
i'd decided<br /> 
i'd had enough<br />
and would make that escape.<br />
but if i'd run,<br />
we were on different orbits,<br />
never to cross paths<br />
at all.<br />
something lost<br />
and something gained.

we said goodbye.<br />
i couldn't read you.<br />
did you really want to meet again?<br />
at home <br />
i drank all the beer<br />
i'd been too afraid to bring.<br />
all but the one that broke,<br />
anyway.

i ranted<br />
and raved.<br />
why get your hopes up?<br />
my friends listened<br />
and i listened to them.<br />
then you responded,<br />
and i realized,<br />
that was an overreaction.

SCENE 3

the next day<br />
you became <br />
my bond girl.<br />
but you were never mine.<br />
how could you be,<br />
when following<br />
your own compass<br />
is what i loved about you?

the next time we met,<br />
we sat under <br />
the stars.<br />
you again brought the blanket,<br />
and i actually brought the wine,<br />
but no ted.

we broke curfew.<br />
sorry richardson,<br />
i'll gladly pay a fine.<br />
it took me awhile to realize,<br />
you cared less about the stars.<br />
i spilled my wine,<br />
and we laughed,<br />
and talked.<br />
you wanted to make <br />
a mark,<br />
i could only agree,<br />
you always had <br />
beautiful words.<br />
we sat quietly<br />
under the stars.

SCENE 4

there was late night sushi<br />
and converstations about <br />
a kiss.<br />
there was mediterranean<br />
and a kiss.

i laid beside you,<br />
and looked into those<br />
green eyes.<br />
i lost track of time<br />
and thought.

if eyes are<br /> 
windows to the soul.<br />
then yours<br />
glimmers.

when you left,<br />
i knew,<br />
the reality<br />
was better than<br />
the dream. 

SCENE 5

the fire in your eyes,<br />
had lept to my own.<br />
i had to<br />
say,<br />
do,<br />
act,<br />
live,<br />
be.

i tried to put you into words.<br />
none seemed to fit.<br />
not because they didn't apply,<br />
but because,<br />
just as light is not only<br /> 
blue<br />
or red<br />
or yellow<br />
but a mixture of all,<br />
no single word<br />
could give<br />
your shape<br />
and i couldn't find<br />
a prism.

you became <br />
my muse.<br />
but you were never mine.<br />
how could you be,<br />
when following<br />
your own compass<br />
is what i loved about you?

there were<br />
cuba libres<br />
and<br />
coldplay.<br />
laughter.<br />
in the morning,<br />
colombian coffee<br />
in bed.

magic.<br />
seven years in the dark<br />
bad been <br />
forgiven.

the reality<br />
was better than<br />
the dream. 

i tried words again.<br />
better now.<br />
a poem<br />
hidden in<br />
a book.

pho,<br />
talking about<br />
eating ants,<br />
coloraduh,<br />
and the city<br />
where the sun sets<br />
at three.<br />
what had been <br />
an escape<br />
was now <br />
a hope.

picky about the milk,<br />
only almond<br />
would do.<br />
captain crunch,<br />
jack's mannequin.<br />
the morning.<br />
you left<br />
and i didn't know<br /> 
so much time<br />
would separate our <br />
eyes.

SCENE 6

i couldn't hurt you<br />
and then i did.<br />
or did i only hurt<br />
myself?

fears from a past <br />
returned.<br />
my words broke.<br />
we tried again.<br />
and again <br />
i slipped.<br />
lost my <br />
footing.<br />
came<br />
tumbling <br />
down.

you called.<br />
i knew<br />
shame.<br />
i'd let you<br />
down.<br />
destroyed<br />
an idea<br />
six weeks in the making.

i heard<br />
every word.<br />
we said<br />
goodbyes?<br />
was the reality<br />
better than<br />
the dream? 

maybe we were on different orbits,<br />
never to cross paths<br />
again.<br />
everything lost<br />
and nothing gained.

SCENE 7 

at the bottom,<br />
i found<br />
the map<br />
and headed towards<br /> 
the signal fire,<br />
that was <br />
you.<br />
something to <br />
light<br />
my path<br />
even if<br />
there was nothing a<br />t
the end.

i knew of <br />
the variables<br />
i could not<br />
control.<br />
time,<br />
distance,<br />
waning desire,<br />
someone new.

i knew of<br />
odds and probabilities.<br />
not in my favor?<br />
they were never<br />
in favor.<br />
people<br />
and places<br />
and things<br />
and you<br />
should not have happened.<br />
but they did.<br />
and i'd walk<br />
a million miles<br />
for the smallest chance<br /> 
of seeing<br />
you.

bought a bike,<br />
thirty miles <br />
and crashes <br />
and black eyes<br />
are easier<br />
with you<br />
in mind.<br />
biking<br />
a million miles<br />
is easier<br />
anyway.

cooked a little.<br />
pasta.<br />
unsure if <br />
the choice of menu<br />
was intentional.

dissertations<br />
and dreams.<br />
progress.<br />
pieces of unsolved<br />
puzzles<br />
falling into <br />
place.

school for teddy.<br />
he's not phd material<br />
but he stays very well.<br />
he stays well.<br />
sometimes he stays.<br />

appointments<br />
and sessions.<br />
waiting rooms full of<br /> 
broken people.<br />
maybe hemingway was right:<br />
we are all broken,<br />
that's how the light gets in.

the ghost of <br />
green hall<br />
stopped haunting.<br />
as fears slipped away,<br />
they were like objects in space,<br />
speeding by,<br />
never to cross paths<br />
again.<br />
nothing lost<br />
and something gained.<br />
and then,<br />
nothing lost<br />
and everything gained.

even as things<br />
left and filled<br />
my life.<br />
i missed<br />
you.

and the truth is<br />
i wondered if <br />
we were objects in space,<br />
speeding by,<br />
never to cross paths<br />
again.<br />
something lost<br />
and everything gained.

SCENE 8

three weeks.
i told myself:
i gotta see about
a girl.

prepared for
the funeral.
was shocked you replied.
too late for
the fair.
someone will find
a ticket in a book
in 2051.

something had
changed.
no longer
texts at 
night
when
you could not
sleep.

in my phone
you became
z.
easier
to not see you
every time i dialed.

rainy night.
i wanted you to know
who i was.
rainy day.
a voicemail.
texting.
incessant.
what about a hockey game?

you ever have
a million words to say
and only
a text to say it?

restless thoughts.
a walk.
pouring rain.
a phone call.
z.

that voice.
like a high.
you forget 
the pleasure
feel it again
and remember
why you want
more.

talked about
you
then me,
your country.
my fear:
someone new,
not my business.
but did we have a
connection?
we did.
tv shows.
friends.
we laughed.
hour and a half.
how about the hockey game?
next week too ambitious.
but with
good night,
hope.

another phone call.
talked about
costumes,
the moon and stars.
spun a story.
i know we joked,
but a crash
would be bad for both of us.
that book would be a best-seller,
though.

halloween.
an object in space
flied by.
talked with someone new 
or two.
fizzled out.
my standards are too high
now.
roses.
petals or thorns.
i wonder.

you became my
green eyes.
but you were never mine.
how could you be,
when following
your own compass
is what i loved about you?

actually,
you were
ojos verdes,
the day we first met.
because
like the song
how could anyone deny you?

SCENE

29 years.
what have i learned?

perhaps
life is a current.
fight against it
and it will knock you
down.
stay down
and you will
drown.
but swim with it
and it will
carry you along.

maybe jobs was right:
you can poke life.
it's not abstract or dead,
but something that responds
to the touch.

fear
never did 
anyone 
any good.
hiding in your room
playing it safe
doesn't keep life,
it kills.
because
if we haven't hurt,
we haven't lived.

like ted,
fear's bark
is way worse than
its bite.

fields:
possibility
cannot exist
without uncertainty.
like hope
and disappointment 
they are two sides
of the same coin.

if things were always right
life would not be vivid
blue
and red
and yellow.
but colorless,
a dull grey.

i'm unsure
if things happen for 
a reason.
or if reasons
are the stories we make 
to find 
meaning.
maybe
the point of it all
is that it doesn't
matter.

we are all
in the same current 
called life.
the same boat.
are we so very different?

of course,
we are different.
and that's
the rub.
we are not all
a dull grey.
some are blue
or red
or yellow.
some green.

the different
shades
and colors.
give us 
shape
and beauty
and depth.
and from this comes 
the universal command:
do you,
man.

do you,
i'll do me.
we must
love ourselves
because
without that
we cannot
love others.

and surely,
we must
love
because 
love is
the currency.
love is
the current
called life.

SCENE

my record player.
records are played in their
entirety.
because
each album is
a story.
the way
the artist
intended.
stories like
our lives.

we each get
one story 
to tell.
we are each handed
an empty book
with pages
to fill.

you have been part of
my story.
and i realize
i know so little 
about
yours.

you are
finely bound.
i could look at
your cover
all day.
beautiful.
i've yet to find another
so perfectly drawn.

but truly it is 
your words
your pages
that fascinate me.

i read
a sentence here
and there.
snuck 
a paragraph
or two.

i marveled.
i wanted more.
but the book
kept moving.
i never finished it.
and really,
unfinished stories
are the ones that
call to you.

truth be told,
i've read too many
stories,
listened to too much 
music,
seen too many 
movies.
too much
hey jude
not enough
hey you.

i used to wonder
whether it was all
fiction.
the dreams 
they sold
were not
reality.

but now
i know
every great
book,
song,
and movie
are real
yet
poorly made
copies
of something
better.

too,
i know
that you can remove
the mis from every 
mistake.
sometimes the right 
scene
needs more than one 
take.

and
while we're on the 
topic,
i have to 
ask:
it wasn't 500 days
but are you
summer
or autumn? 

SCENE

more than one
has said
writing
is like
making
love.

since i have not
seen you
in so long,
please accept
every
word
as the
kisses
and caresses
they are.

i miss
touching your
lips,
feeling your
hair,
rubbing your
shoulders,
grabbing your
hands,
kissing your
skin.

i miss
hearing your
laugh,
your voice,
your soul.

and if
you couldn't tell,
i miss
looking into your
green eyes.

SCENE

telling you
this,
i know
there are
variables
i cannot
control.

you have your own
life,
hopes,
needs,
wants,
and dreams.
you probably even have
a flaw
or two.
i'm just
a guy
you first met
in pictures and words.

still.
i'm a little curious.
aren't you?
maybe
we should
write together
a little bit more.
even if only
a chapter
or two.
each one
better than
the last.

you don't have to use
a blue
pen.
don't you have
a different color,
anyway?

regardless,
keep filling
your pages
with
the beautiful words
i know 
you will.
make 
the dream
the reality.

too,
i know
what i want,
but in a world with
the bataclan,
we must appreciate
whatever we get.

forgive me,
i must 
try.
the beauty
is all in 
the try
and not in
the things we call
success
and failure.

even when we
slip
something will catch us in
the end.

maybe 
we are on different orbits,
never to cross paths
again.
everything lost
and something gained.
or maybe,
we are on orbits,
heading to cross paths
again.
everything lost
and everything gained.

at least
know
you've changed
at least one object's
trajectory.

SCENE

today.
early morning.
turning in
homework.
lost in 
odds and probabilities.

blue pen.
green building.
counting
dots in squares.
i am
five.

the math is 
wrong.
it should be
one and not two.
how...?
it does not
matter.
under the
door.

thoughts.
does
green eyes
have class?
knees wobble.

text her!
don't be
afraid.
don't have
regrets.
try.
no.
don't be
afraid.
try
a new thing.
let go.

funny.
the closest
in months.
and maybe 
the closest 
i'll ever be.

will you let me see<br />
those<br />
green eyes?<br />
