SCENE 1

the writer, <br />
vonnegut, <br />
says to write for<br />
an audience of one.<br />
so though many will read this,<br />
it is only for your <br />
green eyes.<br />

i remember when we first met,<br />
you said you liked my dog,<br />
and said you liked his name.<br />
if i saved his life ten times over,<br />
i couldn't pay him back.<br />

i looked at pictures,<br />
approximations of <br />
you.<br />
i read your words,<br />
only a summary of your<br /> 
soul.<br />

but still,<br />
even then,<br />
you grabbed me.<br />

i asked of your country,<br />
and found it was <br />
the place<br />
my heart has always been.<br />
at least a quarter of it, <br />
anyway.

a place i have roots,<br />
a place that calls to me. <br />
a place where they speak,<br />
a language from my youth.

i have been indifferent<br />
to so many others.<br />
if we clicked,<br />
we clicked.<br />
but if not,<br />
we'd be like objects in space,<br />
speeding by,<br />
never to cross paths<br />
again.<br />
nothing lost<br />
and nothing gained.<br />

but on that night,<br />
i knew,<br />
i must meet you.<br />
you were a dream,<br />
were you a reality?<br />

i put on my best words.<br />
though i flattered you,<br />
it was all<br />
true.

you may not have known<br />
how i was <br />
alone.<br />
but i assure you,<br />
the feeling was mutual.<br />
though it was by<br />
choice.

somehow,<br />
our conversation stretched into<br />
the next day.

i thought of your voice.<br />
i knew it must be <br />
beautiful.<br />
i wondered if i would hear it.<br />

i told el artista<br />
how badly<br />
i wanted to woo you.<br />

i was in a room of people<br />
when you said you'd call.<br />
i left the room,<br />
sat on stairs, <br />
and looked at empty cars.<br />

you never called.<br />
maybe we were on different orbits,<br />
never to cross paths<br />
again.<br />
something lost<br />
and nothing gained.<br />

SCENE 2

but the next day,<br />
you asked what i should have.<br />
why should we call,<br />
when we could meet?<br />

of course,<br />
to meet,<br />
we had to call.<br />

i remember when i first heard your<br />
voice,<br />
the reality<br />
was better than<br />
the dream.

funny.<br />
we both took classes<br />
in that green building.<br />
how many times<br />
had we passed by,<br />
walking a hallway,<br />
driving a road.<br />
only to meet<br />
in pictures and words.<br />

you asked if i was nervous.<br />
i'm a terrible liar.<br />
hell yes,<br />
i was nervous.<br />

stargazing<br />
too ambitious.<br />
we'd meet<br />
at that park downtown.<br />
you'd bring a blanket for sitting,<br />
and i'd grab the drinks for drinking, <br />
and the teddy for petting.<br />

teddy roosevelt.<br />
not to be trusted.<br />
a pup in a pit's body.<br />
but hungry and curious.<br />
maybe not unlike me<br />
or you.

bringing him was<br /> 
a risk.<br />
but if you wanted me to bring him along,<br />
i sure as hell was bringing him along.

i left early,<br />
got lost,<br />
couldn't find the wine,<br />
and when i texted i was close,<br />
realized you hadn't left. 

got lost<br />
downtown,<br />
$20 to park<br />
(worth it),<br />
got nervous and left the beer.

walked to the park<br /> 
where a drunk couple fawned over ted.<br />
couldn't find you,<br />
heard annoyance in that <br />
pretty voice.

wondered if my<br /> 
chance<br />
was slipping<br /> 
away.<br />
another couple<br />
thought ted a killer.<br />
and i was glad to get around<br />
the corner.

looked around.<br />
didn't see you.<br />
then i heard my name<br />
in a familiar<br />
note.

there you were<br />
standing under <br />
the light.<br />
that moment<br />
is not like part of a dream<br />
that you forget when you wake.<br />
i can't forget <br />
because<br />
the reality<br />
was better than<br />
the dream. 

i put my arms around you for<br /> 
the first time.<br />
we sat and talked.<br />
teddy was restless,<br />
almost lost my chair.<br />
surely that is all part of<br />
the charm?

we moved to the grass.<br />
while children ran around us,<br />
we sized each other<br />
up.

we laughed,<br />
we advanced,<br />
and then retreated.<br />
we rinsed<br />
and repeated.<br />
who are you?<br />
who am i?

teddy barked<br />
and bolted.<br />
my head,<br />
your knee.<br />
it only hurt<br />
my pride.

you told me of that city<br />
where the sun sets at three.<br />
i knew this because<br />
that city<br />
had been my escape.

el artista knows how many times<br />
i'd decided<br /> 
i'd had enough<br />
and would make that escape.<br />
but if i'd run,<br />
we were on different orbits,<br />
never to cross paths<br />
at all.<br />
something lost<br />
and something gained.

we said goodbye.<br />
i couldn't read you.<br />
did you really want to meet again?<br />
at home <br />
i drank all the beer<br />
i'd been too afraid to bring.<br />
all but the one that broke,<br />
anyway.

i ranted<br />
and raved.<br />
why get your hopes up?<br />
my friends listened<br />
and i listened to them.<br />
then you responded,<br />
and i realized,<br />
that was an overreaction.

SCENE 3

the next day<br />
you became <br />
my bond girl.<br />
but you were never mine.<br />
how could you be,<br />
when following<br />
your own compass<br />
is what i loved about you?

the next time we met,<br />
we sat under <br />
the stars.<br />
you again brought the blanket,<br />
and i actually brought the wine,<br />
but no ted.

we broke curfew.<br />
sorry richardson,<br />
i'll gladly pay a fine.<br />
it took me awhile to realize,<br />
you cared less about the stars.<br />
i spilled my wine,<br />
and we laughed,<br />
and talked.<br />
you wanted to make <br />
a mark,<br />
i could only agree,<br />
you always had <br />
beautiful words.<br />
we sat quietly<br />
under the stars.

SCENE 4

there was late night sushi<br />
and converstations about <br />
a kiss.<br />
there was mediterranean<br />
and a kiss.

i laid beside you,<br />
and looked into those<br />
green eyes.<br />
i lost track of time<br />
and thought.

if eyes are<br /> 
windows to the soul.<br />
then yours<br />
glimmers.

when you left,<br />
i knew,<br />
the reality<br />
was better than<br />
the dream. 

SCENE 5

the fire in your eyes,<br />
had lept to my own.<br />
i had to<br />
say,<br />
do,<br />
act,<br />
live,<br />
be.

i tried to put you into words.<br />
none seemed to fit.<br />
not because they didn't apply,<br />
but because,<br />
just as light is not only<br /> 
blue<br />
or red<br />
or yellow<br />
but a mixture of all,<br />
no single word<br />
could give<br />
your shape<br />
and i couldn't find<br />
a prism.

you became <br />
my muse.<br />
but you were never mine.<br />
how could you be,<br />
when following<br />
your own compass<br />
is what i loved about you?

there were<br />
cuba libres<br />
and<br />
coldplay.<br />
laughter.<br />
in the morning,<br />
colombian coffee<br />
in bed.

magic.<br />
seven years in the dark<br />
bad been <br />
forgiven.

the reality<br />
was better than<br />
the dream. 

i tried words again.<br />
better now.<br />
a poem<br />
hidden in<br />
a book.

pho,<br />
talking about<br />
eating ants,<br />
coloraduh,<br />
and the city<br />
where the sun sets<br />
at three.<br />
what had been <br />
an escape<br />
was now <br />
a hope.

picky about the milk,<br />
only almond<br />
would do.<br />
captain crunch,<br />
jack's mannequin.<br />
the morning.<br />
you left<br />
and i didn't know<br /> 
so much time<br />
would separate our <br />
eyes.

SCENE 6

i couldn't hurt you<br />
and then i did.<br />
or did i only hurt<br />
myself?

fears from a past <br />
returned.<br />
my words broke.<br />
we tried again.<br />
and again <br />
i slipped.<br />
lost my <br />
footing.<br />
came<br />
tumbling <br />
down.

you called.<br />
i knew<br />
shame.<br />
i'd let you<br />
down.<br />
destroyed<br />
an idea<br />
six weeks in the making.

i heard<br />
every word.<br />
we said<br />
goodbyes?<br />
was the reality<br />
better than<br />
the dream? 

maybe we were on different orbits,<br />
never to cross paths<br />
again.<br />
everything lost<br />
and nothing gained.

SCENE 7 

at the bottom,<br />
i found<br />
the map<br />
and headed towards<br /> 
the signal fire,<br />
that was <br />
you.<br />
something to <br />
light<br />
my path<br />
even if<br />
there was nothing at<br />
the end.

i knew of <br />
the variables<br />
i could not<br />
control.<br />
time,<br />
distance,<br />
waning desire,<br />
someone new.

i knew of<br />
odds and probabilities.<br />
not in my favor?<br />
they were never<br />
in favor.<br />
people<br />
and places<br />
and things<br />
and you<br />
should not have happened.<br />
but they did.<br />
and i'd walk<br />
a million miles<br />
for the smallest chance<br /> 
of seeing<br />
you.

bought a bike,<br />
thirty miles <br />
and crashes <br />
and black eyes<br />
are easier<br />
with you<br />
in mind.<br />

biking<br />
a million miles<br />
is easier than<br />
walking<br />
anyway.

cooked a little.<br />
pasta.<br />
unsure if <br />
the choice of menu<br />
was intentional.

dissertations<br />
and dreams.<br />
progress.<br />
pieces of unsolved<br />
puzzles<br />
falling into <br />
place.

school for teddy.<br />
he's not phd material<br />
but he stays very well.<br />
he stays well.<br />
sometimes he stays.<br />

appointments<br />
and sessions.<br />
waiting rooms full of<br /> 
broken people.<br />
maybe hemingway was right:<br />
we are all broken,<br />
that's how the light gets in.

the ghost of <br />
green hall<br />
stopped haunting.<br />
as fears slipped away,<br />
they were like objects in space,<br />
speeding by,<br />
never to cross paths<br />
again.<br />
nothing lost<br />
and something gained.<br />
and then,<br />
nothing lost<br />
and everything gained.

even as things<br />
left and filled<br />
my life.<br />
i missed<br />
you.

and the truth is<br />
i wondered if <br />
we were objects in space,<br />
speeding by,<br />
never to cross paths<br />
again.<br />
something lost<br />
and everything gained.

SCENE 8

three weeks.<br />
i told myself:<br />
i gotta see about<br />
a girl.

prepared for<br />
the funeral.<br />
was shocked you replied.<br />
too late for<br />
the fair.<br />
someone will find<br />
a ticket in a book<br />
in 2051.

something had<br />
changed.<br />
no longer<br />
texts at night<br />
when you could not<br />
sleep.

in my phone<br />
you became<br />
z.<br />
easier<br />
to not see you<br />
every time i dialed.

rainy night.<br />
i wanted you to know<br />
who i was.<br />
rainy day.<br />
a voicemail.<br />
texting.<br />
incessant.<br />
what about a hockey game?

you ever have<br />
a million words to say<br />
and only<br />
a text to say it?

restless thoughts.<br />
a walk.<br />
pouring rain.<br />
a phone call.<br />
z.

that voice.<br />
like a high.<br />
you forget <br />
the pleasure<br />
feel it again<br />
and remember<br />
why you want<br />
more.

talked about<br />
you<br />
then me,<br />
your country.<br />
my fear:<br />
someone new,<br />
not my business.<br />
but did we have a<br />
connection?<br />
we did.<br />
tv shows.<br />
friends.<br />
we laughed.<br />
hour and a half.<br />
how about the hockey game?<br />
next week too ambitious.<br />
but with<br />
good night,<br />
hope.

another phone call.<br />
talked about<br />
costumes,<br />
the moon and stars.<br />
spun a story.<br />
i know we joked,<br />
but a crash<br />
would be bad for both of us.<br />
that book would be a best-seller,<br />
though.

halloween.<br />
objects in space<br />
flew by.<br />
talked with someone new <br />
or two.<br />
fizzled out.<br />
my standards are too high<br />
now.<br />
roses.<br />
petals or thorns.<br />
i wonder.

you became my<br />
green eyes.<br />
but you were never mine.<br />
how could you be,<br />
when following<br />
your own compass<br />
is what i loved about you?

actually,<br />
you were<br />
ojos verdes,<br />
the day we first met.<br />
because<br />
like the song<br />
how could anyone deny you?

SCENE 9

29 years.<br />
what have i learned?<br />

perhaps<br />
life is a current.<br />
fight against it<br />
and it will knock you<br />
down.<br />
stay down<br />
and you will<br />
drown.<br />
but swim with it<br />
and it will<br />
carry you along.

maybe jobs was right:<br />
you can poke life.<br />
it's not abstract or dead,<br />
but something that responds<br />
to the touch.

fear<br />
never did <br />
anyone <br />
any good.<br />
hiding in your room<br />
playing it safe<br />
doesn't keep life,<br />
it kills.<br />
because<br />
if we haven't hurt,<br />
we haven't lived.

like ted,<br />
bark<br />
worse than<br />
its bite.

fields:<br />
possibility<br />
cannot exist<br />
without uncertainty.<br />

like hope<br />
and disappointment <br />
they are two sides<br />
of the same coin.

if things were always right<br />
life would not be vivid<br />
blue<br />
and red<br />
and yellow.<br />
but colorless,<br />
a dull grey.<br />

i'm unsure<br />
if things happen for <br />
a reason.<br />
or if reasons<br />
are the stories we make <br />
to find <br />
meaning.<br />
maybe<br />
the point of it all<br />
is that it doesn't<br />
matter.

we are all<br />
in the same current <br />
called life.<br />
the same boat.<br />
are we so very different?<br />

of course,<br />
we are different.<br />
and that's<br />
the rub.<br />
we are not all<br />
a dull grey.<br />
some are blue<br />
or red<br />
or yellow.<br />
some green.

the different<br />
shades<br />
and colors.<br />
give us <br />
shape<br />
and beauty<br />
and depth.<br />
and from this comes <br />
the universal command:<br />
do you,<br />
man.

do you,<br />
i'll do me.<br />
we must<br />
love ourselves<br />
because<br />
without that<br />
we cannot<br />
love others.

and surely,<br />
we must<br />
love<br />
because <br />
love is<br />
the currency.<br />
love is<br />
the current<br />
called life.

SCENE 10

my record player.<br />
records are played in their<br />
entirety.<br />
because<br />
each album is<br />
a story.<br />
the way<br />
the artist<br />
intended.<br />
stories like<br />
our lives.

we each get<br />
one story <br />
to tell.<br />
we are each handed<br />
an empty book<br />
with pages<br />
to fill.

you have been part of<br />
my story.<br />
and i realize<br />
i know so little <br />
about<br />
yours.

you are<br />
finely bound.<br />
i could look at<br />
your cover<br />
all day.<br />
beautiful.<br />
i've yet to find another<br />
so perfectly drawn.

but truly it is <br />
your words<br />
your pages<br />
that fascinate me.

i read<br />
a sentence here<br />
and there.<br />
snuck <br />
a paragraph<br />
or two.

i marveled.<br />
i wanted more.<br />
but the book<br />
kept moving.<br />
i never finished it.<br />
and really,<br />
unfinished stories<br />
are the ones that<br />
call to you.

truth be told,<br />
i've read too many<br />
stories,<br />
listened to too much <br />
music,<br />
seen too many<br /> 
movies.<br />
too much<br />
hey jude<br />
not enough<br />
hey you.

i used to wonder<br />
whether it was all<br />
fiction.<br />
the dreams <br />
they sold<br />
were not<br />
reality.

but now<br />
i know<br />
every great<br />
book,<br />
song,<br />
and movie<br />
are real<br />
yet<br />
poorly made<br />
copies<br />
of something<br />
better.

too,<br />
i know<br />
that you can remove<br />
the mis from every <br />
mistake.<br />
sometimes the right<br /> 
scene<br />
needs more than one<br /> 
take.

and<br />
while we're on the<br /> 
topic,<br />
i have to <br />
ask:<br />
it wasn't 500 days<br />
but are you<br />
summer<br />
or autumn? 

SCENE 11

more than one<br />
has said<br />
writing<br />
is like<br />
making<br />
love.

since i have not<br />
seen you<br />
in so long,<br />
please accept<br />
every<br />
word<br />
as the<br />
kisses<br />
and caresses<br />
they are.

i miss<br />
touching your<br />
lips,<br />
feeling your<br />
hair,<br />
rubbing you<br />r
shoulders,<br />
grabbing your<br />
hands,<br />
kissing your<br />
skin.

i miss<br />
hearing your<br />
laugh,<br />
your voice,<br />
your soul.

and if<br />
you couldn't tell,<br />
i miss<br />
looking into your<br />
green eyes.

SCENE 12

telling you<br />
this,<br />
i know<br />
there are<br />
variables<br />
i cannot<br />
control.

you have your own<br />
life,<br />
hopes,<br />
needs,<br />
wants,<br />
and dreams.<br />
you probably even have<br />
a flaw<br />
or two.<br />
i'm just<br />
a guy<br />
you first met<br />
in pictures and words.

still.<br />
i'm a little curious.<br />
aren't you?<br />
maybe<br />
we should<br />
write together<br />
a little bit more.<br />
even if only<br />
a chapter<br />
or two.<br />
each one<br />
better than<br />
the last.

you don't have to use<br />
a blue<br />
pen.<br />
don't you have<br />
a different color,<br />
anyway?

regardless,<br />
keep filling<br />
your pages<br />
with<br />
the beautiful words<br />
i know <br />
you will.<br />
make <br />
the dream<br />
the reality.

too,<br />
i know<br />
what i want,<br />
but in a world with<br />
the bataclan,<br />
we must appreciate<br />
whatever we get.

forgive me,<br />
i must <br />
try.<br />
the beauty<br />
is all in <br />
the try<br />
and not in<br />
the things we call<br />
success<br />
and failure.

even when we<br />
slip<br />
something will catch us in<br />
the end.

maybe <br />
we are on different orbits,<br />
never to cross paths<br />
again.<br />
everything lost<br />
and something gained.<br />
or maybe,<br />
we are on orbits,<br />
heading to cross paths<br />
again.<br />
everything lost<br />
and everything gained.

at least<br />
know<br />
you've changed<br />
one object's<br />
trajectory.<br />

SCENE 13

today.<br />
early morning.<br />
turning in<br />
homework.<br />
lost in <br />
odds and probabilities.

blue pen.<br />
green building.<br />
counting<br />
dots in squares.<br />
i am<br />
five.

the math is<br /> 
wrong.<br />
it should be<br />
one and not two.<br />
how...?<br />
it doesn't<br />
matter.<br />
under the<br />
door.

thoughts.<br />
does<br />
green eyes<br />
have class?<br />
knees wobble.

text her.<br />
don't be<br />
afraid.<br />
don't have<br />
regrets.<br />
try.<br />
no.<br />
don't be<br />
afraid.<br />
try<br />
a new thing.<br />
let go.

funny.<br />
the closest<br />
in months.<br />
and maybe <br />
the closest <br />
i'll ever be.

will you let me see<br />
those<br />
green eyes?<br />

SCEN...
