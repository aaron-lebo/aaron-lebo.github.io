  <h1>about</h1>
  <p>My name is Aaron Lebo. I am from Dallas, Texas. I've been doing computer programming in a number of languages since 2005, and am currently working on a PhD in political science at the University of Texas at Dallas. I'm fascinated by the ability of information and communication to change the world for the better.</p>
  <p>I own a red-nosed pitbull named <a href="http://imgur.com/eAYonV3">Teddy Roosevelt</a>. Aside from being a spaz sometimes, he is a great dog. Pitbulls get such an unfair rap. I'd like to believe that says something about people, too.
